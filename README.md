# Signs O' Plenty

This simple addon mod adds all the missing signs to Biomes o' Plenty, with support for all 11 wood types.

Installation is as simple as dropping the mod JAR file into the mods folder. This addon mod requires the base mod Biomes o' Plenty and does not contain the sign assets as the assets are only in the base mod.
